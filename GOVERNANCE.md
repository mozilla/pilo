# Governance

This document describes the governance model for the Spark project.

## Overview

Spark is developed and maintained by the Tabstack team at Mozilla. We welcome contributions from the community and aim to make the contribution process transparent and collaborative.

## Roles

### Maintainers

Maintainers have full write access to the repository and are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Managing releases
- Setting project direction and priorities
- Ensuring code quality and architectural consistency

**Current Maintainers:**

| Name            | GitHub                                     | Role            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Travis Beauvais | [@tbeauvais](https://github.com/tbeauvais) | Lead Maintainer |

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute to the project through:

- Submitting pull requests
- Reporting bugs and issues
- Improving documentation
- Participating in discussions

All contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Decision Making

### Day-to-Day Decisions

Routine decisions (bug fixes, minor features, documentation updates) are made by maintainers through the normal pull request review process.

### Significant Changes

For significant changes (new features, architectural changes, breaking changes):

1. Open an issue or discussion to propose the change
2. Allow time for community feedback (typically 1-2 weeks for major changes)
3. Maintainers will make the final decision, taking community input into account

### Conflict Resolution

If consensus cannot be reached, the Lead Maintainer has final decision-making authority.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed contribution guidelines.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Maintainer status is granted to contributors who have demonstrated:

- Consistent, high-quality contributions over time
- Deep understanding of the codebase and project goals
- Commitment to the project's long-term success
- Alignment with Mozilla's values and mission

If you're interested in becoming a maintainer, continue contributing and engage with the existing maintainers. We actively look for contributors to grow into maintainer roles.

## Changes to Governance

Changes to this governance document require approval from the Lead Maintainer and will be discussed openly with the community before implementation.
