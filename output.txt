Does the job for a competitive price considering the brand. Very compact and perfect for the space I have it in. I wouldn’t consider myself a tech person, but set up was not difficult at all. Prints fine wirelessly, clean prints, and vibrant colors. I bought it for our small business so the speed is good for its purpose. I haven’t experienced cartridge changing yet but I’ll update here if I run into any issues.

Laser printers have a reputation for being bulky beasts, which is true for most professional models and those designed for photography and graphic work. This one, however, is a personal or small office printer that prints at 24 ppm, fully compatible with the latest Apple technologies, very easy to set up, and delivered with ready-to-use toner cartridges—just plug it in, and it's good to go. The print quality is excellent, and you can find compatible toners that will cost you less than what you typically spend on an inkjet printer. Having used all kinds of laser printers in my life—the first one being an Apple—I’m accustomed to high-end graphic laser printers. Yet, the HP Color LaserJet Pro 3201dw impressed me greatly, despite being designed purely for office use. The only issue I encountered was getting it recognized on the Ethernet network. I initially set it up via Wi-Fi, then forced a firmware update, after which it became visible on the Ethernet network. In conclusion, this is a very good color laser printer, seemingly reliable.

It is borderline unusable over wifi. Easy to setup, easy to use, print quality is fine as well. Plug it in, connect it to wifi, add it to your laptop or phone, print. Easy. Everything works fine the first time. However next time you try to print anything from the laptop or the phone nothing will work. It will say "printer is offline" and after that, no matter what you do to it, there is no reliable way to refresh its status and force it to print anything. Reboot the printer - doesn't matter, says "offline", reboot the laptop - doesn't matter, "offline". Re-connect the printer to wifi, doesn't matter - "offline". The stupidest thing is that when you open the HP app on the same laptop the app does see the printer and recognizes it as online. Shows you the status, the toner level. But you can't print anything, print queue and print dialogs say it's offline. Then randomly after a few minutes (or a lot of minutes, it's random) it would get recognized as online again and you would be able to print. Until you pause for some period and it becomes offline again. Repeat. There are "troubleshooting" steps like making a default printer, some other similar suggestions. They help maybe once, after the period of inactivity you will be back at square one, everything will say it's offline. And at that point it's already a default printer and all troubleshooting steps performed. Nothing helps. Same when printing from the phone. Trying to add it from the print dialog works the first time. Next times it would say offline. Sometimes it would randomly recognize it as online after a few minutes of staring at the print dialog. But sometimes it wouldn't. When you try to add it over wifi direct it would work the first time. But then again, next time it's offline. And if you remove and attempt to add it again - good luck, the phone would find it but you won't be able to install it. Or you can install HP smart app and whatever other apps it requires to print from the phone. It won't see the printer. But then after you lose the patience and go back to the print dialog, it would be available in the dialog using the HP plugin. What is going on..... Doesn't matter the OS either. MacOS, Windows, Android - same things. Doesn't matter the wifi quality, gone through multiple routers, different bands, through other different settings, and currently sitting right next to it on the same network, unable to print anything but able to do everything else over the same wifi. I dread the next time I need to print anything, I will need to go over all possible combinations of random actions that I think are related. I feel like I am following a cargo cult, where I need to perform some weird dance and press random things in hope that the pinter gods will allow me to send the PDF over and I would get it on a paper by some magic. How hard it is to implement a reliable working wifi printer driver?

This printer has been a fantastic addition to my home office. It’s efficient, reliable, and delivers top-notch print quality. WHY IT’S GREAT: ⭐️ SUPER EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE The printer works seamlessly and handles high-volume printing with ease. ⭐️ IMPRESSIVE PRINT QUALITY Every document comes out sharp and professional-looking—perfect for work or personal use. ⭐️ LONG-LASTING INK SUPPLY It comes with enough ink to last a good while, even for heavy users like me. ⭐️ HIGHLY RECOMMEND While replacement ink can be pricey, the initial supply stretches far, making it worth the investment. IF YOU WANT A RELIABLE PRINTER THAT PERFORMS BEAUTIFULLY, THIS IS THE ONE!

I had previously purchase (kinda sorta) same; my mistake not seeing clearly it was not a colored printer. So I found THIS one. Great reviews! Home office. Set up was a bit challenging without the onscreen (touch screen) but fairly doable to do manually. Boom thought all was good for one week. Went to print again and asked to log in (again); wifi not connected (again) but ok, I had not printed in 5 days so perhaps it did not quite connect. (what do I know...); tried again and still nothing; turn off, turn on, reset. frustrating. They saw an alert; "you may have run out of toner" really? One week? and (toner) low? But ok, perhaps I was sent a printer that isn't up to par for making a mistake ordering original. Now trying to buy a toner. No guidance (this is the toner you need for the printer you just purchased) - which makes me weary to buy and make another mistake. Other than that, when it prints, it prints nicely. #twocents
