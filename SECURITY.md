# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We at [Tabstack](https://tabstack.ai/) take the security of our projects seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

This document outlines the process for reporting vulnerabilities in Pilo.

### Supported Versions

The following versions are currently supported for security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |

**Please ensure you are using a supported version when reporting a vulnerability.**

## How to Report

**Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue.**

To report a security vulnerability, you can either:

1. **Email**: Send a detailed report to [security@tabstack.ai](mailto:security@tabstack.ai)
2. **Discord**: Connect with a Tabstack team member in the [Mozilla AI Discord server](https://discord.gg/HZecKZ89Uu)

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Project Name and Version:** Specify which project and which version(s) are affected.
2. **Vulnerability Description:** A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
3. **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any necessary code, configuration, or environment details.
4. **Impact:** Describe the potential impact of the vulnerability (e.g., data breach, denial of service, privilege escalation).
5. **Proof of Concept (Optional but Recommended):** Any proof-of-concept code or demonstration that helps us understand and verify the vulnerability.
6. **Your Contact Information (Optional):** If you wish to be credited for your discovery, please provide your name/handle and preferred contact method.

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 2 business days.
- We will investigate the report promptly and provide an initial assessment within 5 business days.
- We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the vulnerability resolution process.
- Once the vulnerability is patched, we will notify you and, with your permission, include your name in our release notes or security advisory as a thank you for your responsible disclosure.
- We follow a coordinated disclosure approach, meaning we aim to have a fix available before public disclosure.

### Public Disclosure

Please allow us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before public disclosure. We request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have confirmed a fix is available and have agreed on a disclosure timeline.

Our typical disclosure timeline for critical issues is up to 30 days from the initial report, but this may vary depending on complexity.
